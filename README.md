## Folder Structure

### 1. `pytorch-basics/`
Contains tutorial notebooks covering core PyTorch concepts and workflows:

Each subfolder includes a `README.md` summarizing the key lesson and pointing to its notebook.

### 2. `fastai_mini_cv/`
Hands-on experiments following fastai book (Deep Learning for Coders) chapters 5, 13, and 14:
- **ch5_ImageClassification/**  
  DataBlock API experiments, presizing vs. on-the-fly resizing, batch-size comparisons.  
- **ch13_CNN/**  
  Manual convolution implementation, stride/padding tests, visualization of activation maps.  

Each chapter folder contains notebooks (`.ipynb`) with code, results (CSV/plots), and a `README.md` that highlights the chapterâ€™s core concepts.
